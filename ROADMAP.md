# Roadmap + Workflow
This roadmap summarizes the end-to-end data engineering workflow covered in the ZoomCamp.
I’m following the modules in order and documenting:
- Concise notes per video (module `notes/`)
- Runnable practice code (module `src/`)
- Homework submissions (module `homework/`)
> [!NOTE]
> Each module follows the same structure: `notes/` · `src/` · `homework/`.
